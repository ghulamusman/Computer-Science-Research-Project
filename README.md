# Computer-Science-Research-Project
Evaluating Machine learning classifers in an adverserial model with varying classifer parameters to evaluate classifer efficacy.


Project is a part of a larger work focusing on Data Sufficiency and Uniqueness of Behavioural Biometrics(yet to be released).

These are scripts that focus on my final year research work.
